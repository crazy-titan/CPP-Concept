    this is because c++ is the statically language.
    in function i mentioned int so the return of this function must be integer.
    i can return any integer of my choice.

/* 
Now we come to know about the data in C++ 
there are two branch of data 
store and process

store means in form of int , float , string etc and process means loops , for , if else,
for etc.

so, these two are the backbone of C++ just learn these two and start making logics.

And after store and process the last stage is display.
*/

/* identifires

basically get to know about the types of variables, its just inbuilt of the language, 
ie, i can give the name something like int int = 10, this will give errors.

try to give the meaningful names
